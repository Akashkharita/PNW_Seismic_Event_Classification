# Seismic Event Classification in Pacific Northwest

This repository demonstrates the steps towards automated seismic event classification in the Pacific Northwest. We train a supervised machine learning model on the dataset acquired in the pacific northwest. This dataset has four classes - (i) Earthquakes, (ii) Explosions, (iii) Noise and Surface Events. The geographical distribution of these events are shown in the figure below. ![Seismic events in the Pacific Northwest](Figures/Figure_1.png) 
The catalog spans over 20 years from 2001 to 2023 and contains over 200k events majority of which are earthquakes, followed by explosions, followed by noise and surface events. For more information about this catalog check out - [Ni et al. 2023](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/368/868)
The model classifies a 150s window with a user-defined stride and outputs a class and probabilities associated with each class for each window. It is trained to classify the data into four classes - 1. Earthquake, 2. Explosions, 3. Noise and 4. Surface Events. 



## Installation

Instructions on how to install...

If we are running this on the cloud we will look at the instructions in this book to understand how to run this notebook on a cloud - [HPSBook](https://seisscoped.org/HPS-book/chapters/cloud/AWS_101.html).

Once we are in a instance we will run this code - 

```
sudo yum install -y git
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
./miniconda/bin/conda init bash
bash
```

And then we are going to run - 
```
sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
```


Following instructions can be followed on your local system as well as on the cloud (after following the instructions above)


First we will clone the repository by going to the terminal and typing

```
git clone https://github.com/Akashkharita/PNW_Seismic_Event_Classification.git
cd PNW_Seismic_Event_Classification
conda create -y -n surface python=3.9.5
conda activate surface
pip install -r requirements.txt -y
pip install jupyter
conda install -y ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=surface
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```


Then we will enter the repository by

```
cd Surface_Event_Detection
```


Second, let's setup a conda environment using the following command. 

```
conda create -n surface python=3.9.5
```

Activate the environment

```

conda activate surface
```

Then we will install the required dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then we will install the jupyter notebook by running 

```
pip install jupyter
```



Then we will add the conda environment to jupyter hub 
```
conda install ipykernel
```
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=surface
```


Now we are all set to go! ðŸ˜ƒ


If you are on cloud run this - 

```
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```

If you are on local machine, just run this - 

```
jupyter notebook
```



## Usage
The [notebook](Notebooks/Automated_Surface_Event_Detection.ipynb) shows an example of how to detect surface events through continuous seismograms and visualize the results with detailed documentation. I showed the entire process by using three examples of verified surface events (one example each of avalanche, fall and flows). The users are free to run the model on the timing and stations of their choice. 


## Contributing
